# &#127926; Mini Music Player
This project is a mini music player that can be customized and used in websites. Changing the dimensions is possible through the `style.css` file in the `css` folder. If you do not want to change the main functionality and core abilities, do not touch the `miniPlayer.html` file. Only alter this file to change the music track. The `app.js` file is also not to be changed!
