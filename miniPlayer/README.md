# &#127926; Mini Music Player
This project is a mini music player that can be customized and used in websites. Changing the dimensions is possible through the `style.css` file in the `css` folder. If you do not want to change the main functionality and core abilities, do not touch the `miniPlayer.html` file. Only alter this file to change the music track. The `app.js` file is also not to be changed! Also, please consider removing the muting functionality, since this player does not indicate that the music is muted and this might be confusing for many users.
